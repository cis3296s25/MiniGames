# Project MiniGames
This is a web app that has a library of mini games that allow you to enjoy classic games like tic-tac-toe, snake, hangman, and many more. The aim is to provide a simple but engaging user interface to pass time and have fun. Key features of this web app include a home screen with different game selections, a simple score tracker, and user-friendly controls. We are currently working on adding more games! Another potential feature will be the ability to have multiple players on games like tic-tac-toe.
